   HOW TO PUSH CODE TO GITHUB
   (Step-by-step for beginners)
============================================

WHAT IS GITHUB?
---------------
GitHub is like Google Drive for code. You upload your code there,
and then you can download it on any computer.


STEP 1: CREATE GITHUB ACCOUNT
------------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Enter your email, create password
4. Verify your email
5. Done! Remember your username and password


STEP 2: INSTALL GIT ON YOUR COMPUTER
------------------------------------
1. Download Git from: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Run the installer
3. Click "Next" on all options (keep defaults)
4. Restart your computer after installation


STEP 3: CREATE NEW REPOSITORY ON GITHUB
---------------------------------------
1. Login to GitHub.com
2. Click the "+" button (top right corner)
3. Click "New repository"
4. Repository name: Pabbly-Callflow
5. Description: Sales Call Tracking System
6. Keep it PRIVATE (important - has sensitive code)
7. DO NOT check "Initialize with README" (we already have one)
8. Click "Create repository"
9. You'll see a page with commands - KEEP THIS PAGE OPEN


STEP 4: FIRST TIME SETUP (Only needed once)
-------------------------------------------
Open Command Prompt in "Pabbly Callflow" folder:
(Right-click folder → "Open in Terminal" OR "Git Bash Here")

Then copy and paste these commands ONE BY ONE:

1. Tell Git who you are:
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

   (Use the same email you used for GitHub)

2. Initialize Git in this folder:
   git init

3. Add all files:
   git add .

4. Create first save point:
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Pabbly Callflow project"

5. Connect to your GitHub repository:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Pabbly-Callflow.git

   (Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)

6. Push code to GitHub:
   git push -u origin main

   It will ask for username and password:
   - Username: your GitHub username
   - Password: you need to use a "Personal Access Token" (see below)


STEP 5: CREATE PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN (For password)
---------------------------------------------------
GitHub doesn't accept regular passwords anymore. You need a token:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Note: "Pabbly Callflow Access"
4. Expiration: "No expiration"
5. Check the box: "repo" (this gives full repository access)
6. Scroll down, click "Generate token"
7. COPY THE TOKEN - save it somewhere safe (Notepad)
8. You can't see it again after you close the page!
9. Use THIS TOKEN as password when git asks for password


STEP 6: FUTURE UPDATES (Every time you make changes)
----------------------------------------------------
After you've done STEP 4 once, for future updates just:

1. Double-click: PUSH_TO_GITHUB.bat

   OR manually run these commands:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your message about what changed"
   git push origin main


STEP 7: DOWNLOAD CODE ON NEW PC
--------------------------------
When you get a new PC and want to continue working:

1. Install Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Git (like before)

2. Open Command Prompt anywhere and run:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Pabbly-Callflow.git

3. This downloads all your code!

4. Then follow setup:
   cd Pabbly-Callflow

   Create backend/.env file (copy from .env.example)
   Update the database password in .env

   Double-click: FINAL_FIX.bat

5. Done! Your project is running on new PC!


SIMPLE WORKFLOW
---------------
On your current PC:
1. Make changes to code
2. Double-click PUSH_TO_GITHUB.bat
3. Code uploaded to GitHub ✓

On new PC:
1. Run: git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Pabbly-Callflow.git
2. Setup .env file with database password
3. Run FINAL_FIX.bat
4. Start working! ✓


IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
✓ Your .env file (with passwords) is NOT uploaded to GitHub (for security)
✓ So on new PC, you need to create .env again (copy from .env.example)
✓ node_modules folders are NOT uploaded (they're huge!)
✓ Run "npm install" on new PC to download dependencies again
✓ Keep your GitHub repository PRIVATE (it has your project code)
✓ Save your Personal Access Token somewhere safe


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Q: "git is not recognized as a command"
A: You need to install Git first (Step 2)

Q: "Permission denied"
A: Use Personal Access Token as password, not your GitHub password

Q: "Repository not found"
A: Check you typed the GitHub URL correctly with your username

Q: "Already up to date" when pushing
A: This means no new changes to upload - that's fine!
